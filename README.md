** Sales And Inventory Management **
The Sales And Inventory Management segment involves overseeing 
the addition, modification, and deletion of beauty products. This 
responsibility encompasses adjusting prices, and handling stock 
levels in real-time, maintaining an up-to-date product catalog, and 
categorizing items based on men's and women's preferences. The 
system allows customers to browse and purchase products 
conveniently, filtering selections according to their specific 
category. In addition to these features, users can provide reviews for 
every product.
